# Electronic-MuYu
by LLT & GYM

## Overview
This project is a web-based application that simulates an Electronic Muyu (Wooden Fish), a traditional Buddhist percussion instrument. It's designed for users who want to engage in a meditative practice or just enjoy the experience of using a digital version of the Muyu. \n

## How to Use
**Playing the Muyu Sound**: Click the wooden fish image button at the bottom of the screen to play the sound. The button will animate slightly to indicate it's been pressed. 

**Adjusting Volume**: Use the slider in the top right corner of the screen to adjust the volume of the sound. 

**Entering a Wish or Phrase**: Enter your desired text in the input field labeled "许愿" (Wish). This text will animate on the screen with each hit. If no text is entered, "功德+1" (Merit +1) will be displayed by default. 

**Viewing the Hit Count**: The number of times the Muyu has been struck is displayed under "敲击次数" (Number of Hits). 


## Note
This application is designed for entertainment and meditative purposes and is a digital representation of the traditional Wooden Fish used in Buddhist practices.
